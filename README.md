# Machine Learning

The question arises -> Why Machine Learning?
Personally I believe Machine Learning is the one of the disciplines that allow you to explore different fields and learn vast new knowledge each time you do so.

As the name suggests, When the Machine [ROBOT] can learn autonomously.
Spam Filtering, E-Commerce, news feed in social apps etc.

They all are the examples of Mahcine Learning which are evolving daya by day as humans have evolved.

Now what I am more keen about is HOW?
HOW can we make our machines learn. How can we create algorithms for Machine Learning.

Lets start from the basics...
-> Supervised Learning
-> Unsupervised Learning
-> Reinforcement

The building blocks of Machine Learinng can be categorised as:
- Representation -- It includes modelling of data 
- Evaluation -- It includes the function that needs to be evaludated on the basis of provided input and output.
- Optimisation -- It includes the algorithms that optimise the evaluated function.
