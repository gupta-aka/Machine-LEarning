# Machine Learning

The question arises -> Why Machine Learning?
Personally I believe Machine Learning is the one of the disciplines that allow you to explore different fields and learn vast new knowledge each time you do so.

As the name suggests, When the Machine [ROBOT] can learn autonomously.
Spam Filtering, E-Commerce, news feed in social apps etc.

They all are the examples of Mahcine Learning which are evolving daya by day as humans have evolved.

Now what I am more keen about is HOW?
HOW can we make our machines learn. How can we create algorithms for Machine Learning.

Lets start from the basics...
-> Supervised Learning
-> Unsupervised Learning
-> Reinforcement

The building blocks of Machine Learinng can be categorised as:
- Representation -- It includes modelling of data 
- Evaluation -- It includes the function that needs to be evaludated on the basis of provided input and output.
- Optimisation -- It includes the algorithms that optimise the evaluated function.

Key Point: - Machine Learning is the model that gives a certain output for certain set inputs.
So Mathematically, We have input [x] and output [y] also. What we need to find is the function that gives correct output for set of some inputs.
i.e 			y = f(x)  where f() is the Machine learning algorithm which is trained.

Note: Training is done to make sense out of input data.
Four ingredients for training the ML Algorithm are:
-> Data [Mostly a historical data]
-> Model []
-> Objective Function [It estimates how the correct the model output are]
-> Optimisation Algorithm [It consist the mechnaics through which we vary the parameters of the model to optimize Objective function].

Machine Learning is an iterative process.
[Feed the data into model, compare it with objective function, vary it with optimisation function] This process repeats.
